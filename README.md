### Hangman React App

[Link](https://calm-buttercream.netlify.app/)

Welcome to Hangman, a simple React app built with TypeScript! This project is a digital version of the classic word-guessing game, where players attempt to guess a hidden word letter by letter.

### Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- TypeScript: A statically-typed superset of JavaScript, adding type annotations and other features.
- CSS: Cascading Style Sheets for styling the app.
- HTML: Hypertext Markup Language for structuring the app.

### Steps

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` in the root directory
3. Run `npm run build` in the root directory
4. Run `npm start` in the root directory
5. Open `localhost:3000` in your browser

## How to play

1. Enter a letter in the input field (You can use keyboard letters or click the buttons on the screen)
2. If the letter is correct, it will be revealed in the word. Otherwise, a part of the hangman drawing will appear (and wrong letter will be disabled)
3. Keep guessing letters until you either complete the word or the hangman drawing is fully displayed.
4. You can reset the game at any time by clicking the "Reset" button, refresh the page or simply press Enter.
